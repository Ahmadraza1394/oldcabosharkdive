We are the <strong>FIRST COMPANY</strong> providing shark diving <strong>ECO TOURS</strong> where the people can safely dive and swim with sharks in their natural environment.</p><p class="p-3"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Here at Cabo Shark Dive we are active conservationists and ecologists, we really love sharks, we protect them for real and we put lots of effort into it. Part of our profits goes in concrete <strong>CONSERVATION PROJECTS</strong> and <strong>SHARK TAGGING PROJECTS </strong>in collaboration with Mexico Azul Foundation and Pelagios Kakunja. Since 2015 we are monitoring the health of the local shark population gathering datas with <strong>HIGH SCIENTIFIC VALUE</strong>.</span><br></p><p class="p-3"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We involve the local fishing communities in <strong>ECO TOURISM ACTIVITIES</strong>, through donations, training and education we promote ecotourism as a good alternative to fishing. As official Environmental Inspectors of <strong>PROFEPA</strong> (Federal Attorney for Environmental Protection) we protect the ocean from illegal fishing practices, illegal fishing devices and from any harmful behaviour that could damage the marine ecosystem. We work side by side with governmental entities like <strong>SEMAR or CONAPESCA</strong> monitoring the sport and commercial fishing activities to make sure everyone respects the fishing regulations and restrictions as well the rules of the Marine Protected Areas.</span><br></p><p class="p-3"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The <strong>Cabo Shark Dive Team</strong> has spent countless hours exploring more than 150 nautical miles around Cabo, both in the Pacific Ocean and sea of Cortez. We learned perfectly the behaviour of our local sharks and we discovered all the local shark diving sites. Jacob and his team proudly made Cabo San Lucas one of the&nbsp;<strong>WORLD BEST SHARK DIVING DESTINATION!</strong></span><br></p>

We could show you a map outlining where exactly we would take you, but we want to keep some of the locations secret to ensure that you will enjoy a personalised encounter with the sharks, without having to worry about other boats or tourists!</span><br></p><p class="p-3"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">It also boasts a huge variety of marine life directly off the coast. At various times of the year, you can see mobulas, sea lions, and whales, as well as a wide variety of shark species just off the coast.</span><br></p><p class="p-3"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Further along the coast, but still within driving distance, you can also find an even larger variety of marine life. From whale sharks in La Paz to the marlin migration in Magdalena Bay, the Baja peninsula truly has it all.</span><br></p>
